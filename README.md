This fork is for Snap Decal fall 2014 Final Project:

Snap to Python Convertor by Joel and Kevin.

We would be implementing a new c-ring block(like the warp block) that converts Snap! code within itself into Python code. 

The purpose of this project is to ease the transition from Snap! to Python for CS10 students. 

At this point we plant to only provide support for control blocks, operator blocks and variables/lists, as well as the say blocks (as "print" in Python).
